  "0": "A little bit of Raki goes a long way. Add a couple of ice cubes or water, and suddenly it‚Äôs a glory of cloud liquid called 'Aslan S√ºt√º,' meaning 'Lion‚Äôs Milk.' It still has that strong anise taste, which is said to inspire power and bravery. All of these things make it a great digestif or first drink. Raki is also a symbol of Turkish culture and hospitality, often served with meze and enjoyed similarly to sharing a bottle of wine with friends. Turkish Grill in Sunnyside, Queens, is a great place to enjoy Raki. It costs only $12 and comes with this elegant and efficient setup. You can also order delicious Turkish dishes such as kebabs, manti, lahmacun, and baklava to pair with your drink. The restaurant has a fun and cozy atmosphere, with attentive staff and authentic decor. Turkish Grill is open every day from 11:30 am to 10:30 pm (11:00 pm on weekends), and you can order online or make a reservation. Turkish Grill is located at 4203 Queens Blvd, Sunnyside, NY 11104.
