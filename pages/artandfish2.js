     Nicole Burko caught a fish free diving in the depths of
          the Atlantic like a ferocious predator, but photos of her submerged
          laying in wait at the bottom of the sea are more precious and
          beautiful than anything else. How nice it is to know that this
          blackened strip bass came from the hands of a friend, Nicole Burko.

          Check out her art here @nicoleburko on instagram    . Also noteworthy, fried
          plantains forever, pescatarian vibes, and new favourite green --&gt;
          Baby Kale. Not that I donâ€™t love my arugula and red lettuce, but
          that baby kale has the cutest name of the leafy greens that I know
          of. Is their cuter leafy green competition?
