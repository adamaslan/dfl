          Baby Daddy is a great choice for anyone that wants a highly
          drinkable beer that is full of flavor. With so many styles of beer
          available it's easy to make an appreciative glance at the noticeably
          hip design of baby daddy and then get distracted by some other beer
          in the vast array of beers in the world. Ahh...so many tasty beer
          fish in the sea.
        </p>

          Indeed, the anonymity of any beer on the shelf in a major city in
          the US is akin to the modern era of dating. With so many IPAs (not
          to mention session IPAs) on the market, itâ€™s easy to swipe left on
          any beer these days, but Baby Daddy seems to be having more success
          than the rest of the flock these days.

          The good tidings have most likely arisen because of the full-bodied
          IPA taste with a very noticeable grapefruit kick that is still
          incredibly easy to drink. A quality product coupled with cool
          packaging and branding that is emblematic of Speakeasy ales and lagers
          ensures Baby Daddy IPA will be a bevy daddies, mommies, and the
          whole over 21-year-old family will be enjoying for a long time.
          Cheers!
