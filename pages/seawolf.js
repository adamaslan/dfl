            Tasty dollar oysters ‚Ä¶Noted. I had a lot of fun enjoying a beautiful
            day in Bushwick working on some writing at Sea Wolf üê∫. Sea Wolf
            reigns as one of the premiere locations to breath fresh air while
            you eat or drink tasty things.

            A solid happy hour and a diverse menu are also big bonuses. Come for
            the people watching right by the Jefferson L stop. Stay for the
            oysters.{" "}
