            My friend Nicole Burko caught a fish free diving in the depths of
            the Atlantic like a ferocious predator, but photos of her submerged
            laying in wait at the bottom of the sea are more precious and
            beautiful than anything else. How nice it is to know that this
            blackened strip bass came from the hands of a friend, Nicole Burko.{" "}

            Check out her art here @nicoleburko on insta. Also noteworthy, fried
            plantains forever, pescatarian vibes, and new favourite green ->
            Baby Kale. Not that I donâ€™t love my arugula and red lettuce, but
            that baby kale has the cutest name of the leafy greens that I know
            of. Is their cuter leafy green competition?
