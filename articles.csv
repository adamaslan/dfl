On the Love of Raki and Turkish Food 
 
A little bit of Raki goes a long way. Add a couple ice cubes or water and suddenly its a glory of cloud liquid called ""Aslan Sütü"", meaning ""Lion’s Milk"". It still has that strong anise taste which is said to inspire power and bravery. All of these things add up to make it a great digestif or first drink.
 
Raki is also a symbol of Turkish culture and hospitality, often served with meze and enjoyed in a similar way of sharing a bottle of wine with friends.
 
 
Turkish Grill in Sunnyside Queens is a great place to enjoy Raki. It costs only 12 dollars and comes with this elegant and efficient set up. You can also order delicious Turkish dishes, such as kebabs, manti, lahmacun, and baklava, to pair with your drink. The restaurant has a fun and cozy and atmosphere, with attentive staff and authentic decor. Turkish Grill is open every day from 11:30 am to 10:30 pm (11:00 pm on weekends), and you can order online or make a reservation.
Turkish Grill is located at 4203 Queens Blvd, Sunnyside, NY 11104

Summer Cocktails pt.2: Grand Army Punch
by @chemixtry
 
Summer has indeed hit us with some heat. A good sherry elixer for all this sun and humidity is a delicious cocktail by @chemixtry.
 
Grand Army Punch In 1883, Rochester, NY bartender, Patrick H. ""Patsy"" McDonough published this recipe specifically to celebrate the Grand Army of the Republic in observance of Memorial Day; some of whom were his personal friends and acquaintances fighting for the Union in the Civil War. 
For 1 serving of his Grand Army Punch:
1 oz cognac
1 oz oloroso sherry
1 oz white dessert wine
3 oz champagne
0.5 oz lemon juice
Oleo Saccharum from previous recipe ~0.5 oz
Pineapple rings, orange and lemon slices
You could really do almost anything with an oleo saccharum. Keep it simple and pour some good gin or rum over it. But don't forget the ice!

An Awkward Question about Natural Wine 
An awkward question is posed, “hey...there...I'm looking for a ...natural wine...something funky...that isn’t going to cost over twenty five dollars?”
If you are like me, then your normal speaking voice is ridden with pauses so as to humbly point out a lack of certainty. Luckily, the people at
 
Irving Bottle
 
are prepared for this. When it comes to the new movement of natural wines, one could say the whole movement should be speaking in such a tone. A movement that is clearly going to gain steam in 2019, natural wines do not come with a specific certification one has to pay for necessarily, like a wine that is certified organic or biodynamic for example and thus, the definition of natural is open to interpretation.
While the question of what makes a wine natural is clearly an interesting one, another great question is: why is everybody freaking out over natural wines? There are several good answers to that question. You could answer that question by mentioning all the nods to minimalism that comes with natural wine like the lack of or minimal use of sulfites, lack of advanced technology, or lack of filtration. Another way you could answer that question would be to mention how natural wine uses more old school techniques in the wine making process. Lets not forget all the cool labels they come with, boutique distributors, stores, and restaurants all dedicated to natural wine. However, none of these are the best reasons to freak out about natural wine.
What is the best reason? The unique funky taste. When I awkwardly asked an employee at Irving Bottle, located on...Irving Ave (who would have guessed???) in Bushwick Brooklyn, if they had a funky yet affordable natural red, I was delighted to find out that this neighborhood gem did indeed carry an array of such wines. The wine they suggested to me was the Coup de Canon produced by Gregory Leclerc of Domaine Chahut et Prodiges located in the Loire Valley.

5 Reasons Why You Should Drink Loose Teas
 
Lots to say about the tea in its loosest form and genmaicha...and Porto Rico Importing Company which dates back to 1907. Here are 5 reasons why loose tea is great!
Lots of flavor:
 Loose tea leaves are larger and less processed than tea found in bags, which means they retain more of their natural oils and flavor.
Higher quality:
 Loose tea is often made from better quality tea leaves compared to the broken leaves and dust found in tea bags.
Health benefits:
 Loose tea contains antioxidants, polyphenols, and other beneficial compounds that can help support overall health and well-being.
Customizable:
 Loose tea allows for more control over the strength and flavor of your tea. You can adjust the amount of tea leaves and steeping time to your liking.
Eco-friendly:
 Loose tea generates less waste than tea bags, which are often made with non-biodegradable materials like nylon or polyester.

On Art and Spear Fishing 
 
Nicole Burko caught a fish free diving in the depths of the Atlantic like a ferocious predator, but photos of her submerged laying in wait at the bottom of the sea are more precious and beautiful than anything else. How nice it is to know that this blackened strip bass came from the hands of a friend, Nicole Burko.
Check out her art here @nicoleburko on instagram    . Also noteworthy, fried plantains forever, pescatarian vibes, and new favourite green --> Baby Kale. Not that I don’t love my arugula and red lettuce, but that baby kale has the cutest name of the leafy greens that I know of. Is their cuter leafy green competition?
Nicole is also an accomplished painter. She earned an MFA at Columbia is painting and has shown with

Looking for a winter sports destination that offers both luxurious amenities and cost-effective options? Aspen might be just what you're looking for. With its reputation for stylish gluttony, Aspen certainly has plenty of high-end dining options and luxurious accommodations. However, these amenities can come at a high cost, making it difficult for travelers on a budget to fully enjoy all that Aspen has to offer.
On the other hand, Aspen does offer some cost-effective options for those who plan ahead, such as purchasing a multi-day pass or finding affordable dining options. And with its four mountains, including Aspen Mountain and Snowmass, visitors can experience some of the best ski slopes in the world.

Baby Daddy Please 
 
Baby Daddy is a great choice for anyone that wants a highly drinkable beer that is full of flavor. With so many styles of beer available it's easy to make an appreciative glance at the noticeably hip design of baby daddy and then get distracted by some other beer in the vast array of beers in the world. Ahh...so many tasty beer fish in the sea.
Indeed, the anonymity of any beer on the shelf in a major city in the US is akin to the modern era of dating. With so many IPAs (not to mention session IPAs) on the market, it’s easy to swipe left on any beer these days, but Baby Daddy seems to be having more success than the rest of the flock these days.
The good tidings have most likely arisen because of the full-bodied IPA taste with a very noticeable grapefruit kick that is still incredibly easy to drink. A quality product coupled with cool packaging and branding that is emblematic of Speakeasy ales and lagers ensures Baby Daddy IPA will be a bevy daddies, mommies, and the whole over 21-year-old family will be enjoying for a long time. Cheers!

Getting Deep in Coyoacan 
I love Coyoacan. I love Frida Kahlo. What a lovely way to spend the day, visiting the Blue House and the market in Coyoacan! It was also a deeply emotional experience. Having visited a flower-filled graveyard nearby. I was struck by the living flower plants growing amongst freshly laid flowers soon to dry juxtaposed to signs on the graves that would feature sad laments at death and loss. After all of that, I was ready for some

Naples Botanical Garden Welcomes Frida and the Casa Azul 
 
The Frida Kahlo Exhibit at the
 
Naples Botanical Garden
 
is a unique display of Mexican culture, art, and nature. The exhibit showcases replicas from Frida Kahlo's Casa Azul, her garden, and the plants of Mexico, all of which were central to Kahlo's life and art. THE exhibit displays much of her personal style and portrayal of Mexican culture. The Casa Azul, where she was born and raised, is now a museum in Mexico City that houses her personal belongings, artwork, and a collection of Mexican folk art.
The Naples Botanical Garden's Frida Exhibit features replicas of some of Kahlo's most iconic works, including her self-portraits, her famous portraits of Diego Rivera, and her paintings of Mexican culture and nature. The exhibit also includes replicas of Kahlo's personal belongings, such as her traditional Mexican dresses, her jewelry, and her household items. One of the most impressive aspects of the exhibit is the recreation of Kahlo's garden. The garden was a vital part of Kahlo's life, and she spent countless hours tending to it, planting new species of plants and flowers and creating beautiful arrangements. The garden was also a source of inspiration for many of her paintings, including her famous painting, ""The Two Fridas.""
The Naples Botanical Garden's replica of Kahlo's garden includes a variety of plants and flowers that were native to Mexico, such as marigolds, dahlias, and Mexican sunflowers. The garden is arranged in a way that mirrors the layout of Kahlo's original garden, with paths lined with stones and pots filled with brightly colored flowers. The exhibit also features a collection of plants from Mexico that were important to Kahlo, including the agave plant, which is used to make tequila, and the prickly pear cactus, which was a staple food source for the indigenous people of Mexico. These plants are not only beautiful, but they also offer visitors a glimpse into the culture and history of Mexico.
